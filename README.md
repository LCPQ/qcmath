# qcmath

Mathematica modules for electronic structure calculations developed at the 
Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques ([LCPQ](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr)) UMR5626 (Toulouse, France).
qcmath is primarily developed to help newcomers in quantum chemistry to easily develop their own ideas and codes.
Note that qcmath is **not** designed for computational efficiency.

# qcmath abilities

## Ground-state calculations
- Restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF)
- Moller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory
- Various flavours of coupled-cluster (CC) calculations

## Charged excitations
- *GW* approximation
- T-matrix approximation
- Second- and third-order Green's function (GF)

## Neutral excitations
- configuration interaction (CI)
- random-phase approximation (RPA)
- Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)
- algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC)

# Miscellaneous
The computation of integrals within qcmath is currently performed with [QCaml](https://gitlab.com/scemama/QCaml).
All the IO are performed with [TREXIO](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio).
